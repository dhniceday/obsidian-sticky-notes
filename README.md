## In the sticky notes

- text decoration for bold and italic is deactivated

- link color is aligned with sticky note's normal text color

- highlight color is adapted to the sticky note's color

## Options in style settings

- Sticky notes colors

- Choose the font 
    - Fonts are incorporated
    - All fonts are from Google Fonts

- Text size

- Offset for asides

- Zoom on hover (still experimental and not that pretty)

CSS is a bit rough (I'm not an expert). I have created that for myself. It blends into my own Gruvbox color scheme for the Minimal theme. But all of that can be easily modified in the css.

## Examples

```
> [!STICKY]
> The default sticky 
> (takes default color from Style Settings).
```

```
> [!STICKY|yellow left]
> Sticky Note
> This one floats left
```

```
> [!STICKY|green right title]
> Sticky Note
> This one floats right and has its first line bold
```

```
> [!STICKY|blue center s-45]
> Sticky Note
> This one is centered and a bit larger
```

```
> [!STICKY|aside left purple title]
> Sticky Note
> This one is put aside, purple with its first line bold
```
